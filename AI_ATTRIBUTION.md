# AI Attribution

This project was developed with significant assistance from AI tools.

## AI Tools Used

- **Claude (Anthropic)**: Code generation, architecture design, documentation, bug fixes
- **GitHub Copilot**: Code completion and suggestions (if applicable)

## Human Contributions

- Project concept and requirements
- Design decisions and feature prioritization
- Testing and validation
- API key management and deployment
- Code review and refinement

## Transparency

We believe in transparency about AI usage in software development. While AI tools significantly accelerated development and improved code quality, all code has been reviewed, tested, and validated by human developers.

## Methodology

- AI was used as a pair programming assistant
- All AI-generated code was reviewed before being committed
- Security-sensitive code received extra scrutiny
- Documentation was AI-assisted but human-verified
